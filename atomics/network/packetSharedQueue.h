/**
 * Represents a shared buffered within a switch/router.
 * There is a fixed buffer per port (per_port_capacity_bits), which is used only by packets destined to that port (same as several packetQueue.cpp)
 * Additionaly, there is a shared buffered (shared_capacity_bits), which is used by all packets which does not fit in their corresponding fixed queue.
 * Packets are discarded if 1) the fixed buffer is full AND 2) the shared buffer is full
 * Packets are always severed in a FIFO order respecting egress ports request orders. Once a packet is in a given buffer (fixed or shared) stays in that same buffer until sent
 * 
 * Other features implemented:
 *   - (buffer_cell_size_bits != -1) Buffer memory can be setup to be splitted in 'cells' (e.g. as implemented in Juniper ToR QFX5100). The cell size determines the minimum space a packet can use, thus a packet can effectively use more buffer than its size. 
 *   - (port_max_shared_buffer_use_bits) # A single outport can be limited in the amount of shared buffer it can use (e.g. as implemented in Juniper ToR QFX5100). There is a 'dynamic_threadhold' parameter that allows setting the percentage of the shared buffer a single port can use (default is 50%).

 *
 * In port <N (even) > (0,2,4,...): request to dequeue from egress port N/2
 * In port <M (odd) (1,3,5,...: packet destined to egress port N-1/2
 *
 * Outport P: packet sent to egress port P
