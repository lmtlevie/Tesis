/**
 *  Buffers out-of-order TCP packets and forwards them as they are ordered.
 *  Discards duplicated TCP packets.
 *  Demultiplex incoming packets:
 *
 * 	In0: Incoming packets
 * 	out0: non-tcp packets (forwarded immediately)
 * 	out1: all TCP packets (forwarded immediately, usually for receiving side to be able to send ACKs)
 * 	out2: TCP packets delivered in ordered, removing duplicates (forwarding in order of SEQ, as needed by layer 7)
